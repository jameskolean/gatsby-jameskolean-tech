      ZAP is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding
      vulnerabilities in web applications.


      It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security
      experience and as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who
      are new to penetration testing.


      ZAP provides automated scanners as well as a set of tools that allow you
      to find security vulnerabilities manually.
