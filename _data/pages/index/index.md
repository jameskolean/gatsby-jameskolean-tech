##About Me##

I'm James Kolean a full stack developer located in South East Michigan. Most of my work has been in **_SpringBoot_** development as an Architect, Team Lead, and Developer. I've used SpringBoot to build applications for many customers (from Fortune 500 to Startups) in many industries (from Banking to Fantasy Sports).

Recently I have become more interested in **JAMStack Architecture** due to the frustration of writing the same boilerplate code over and over. JAMStack offers a way to get flexible and blazingly fast applications into production quickly.

- It uses technologies like **_GraphQL_**, letting API clients ask for just the data they need. The API designer no longer needs to be clairvoyant of future client needs.
- It uses Static Site Generators Like **GatsbyJS** delivering blazingly fast, secure, SEO compliant, and PWA enabled application out-of-the-box. The term 'Static Site' is a bit of a misnomer since the site is rehydrated into a **dynamic React application**.
- It uses **Headless CMS** to avoid writing the same old CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) application code, allowing more effort to be placed on the highly valuable client-specific business logic.
