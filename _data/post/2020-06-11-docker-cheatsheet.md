title: Docker Cheat Sheet and Alternative

I don't use Docker or Docker-Compose enough to get the command-line muscle memory I would like. To remedy this fact, I thought it would be a good idea to create a cheat sheet to help my future self. After looking around for a bit, I found that I can reference one of many excellent cheat sheets.

However, I found an alternative better than a cheat sheet. VSCode has a docker plugin that is perfect for me. Go to Code > Preferences > Extensions and search for 'ms-azuretools.vscode-docker'. Voila! No more need to memorize command-line comands and options.

If I get the opportunity to use Docker as part of my daily work, I'm sure that I would fall back to the command-line for efficiency. In that case, I might reach for a cheat sheet like one of these:
